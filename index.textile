title: A modern approach to remote javascript
---

Keep the browser logic-less.

Rbjs is a ruby gem that enables you to write remote javascript in Rails 3 or higher. With Rbjs you can render your javascript dynamically on the server and send it back to the client. Use it to quickly prototype your ajax actions. It saves you from the pain of dealing with response handlers and all the fiddly stuff. And once your app gets more javascript-heavy, you can migrate to a sophisticated client library, like "backbone":http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/.

h2(#example).  Show me an example

Sure. This example renders an input box. After entering a message and clicking submit, the message partial is rendered and appended to the list of messages. In addition, the flash message gets updated.

h3. Variation 1

{% highlight erb %}
# in views/messages/index.html.erb
<%= form_for(Message.new, :remote => true) do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :text %>  
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
# in controllers/messages_controller.rb
# POST /messages
def create
  @message = Message.create(params[:message])
  render :js do
    jQuery(render @message).appendTo('#messages').fadeIn(1000)
    jQuery('#flash').html(t 'flash.message.created').show!
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

As an experienced and disciplined Rails developer you might want to go ahead and extract the render call into a template and wrap everything in a _respond_to_ block for graceful degradation. You can do that, too.

h3. Variation 2

{% highlight ruby %}
# in controllers/messages_controller.rb
# POST /messages
# POST /messages.json
def create
  @message = Message.create(params[:message])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { redirect_to :back, notice: t('flash.message.created') }
    format.json { render json: @message, status: :created, location: @message }
    format.js
  end
end

# in views/messages/create.js.rbjs
jQuery(render @message).appendTo('#messages').fadeIn(1000)
jQuery('#flash').html(t 'flash.message.created').show!
{% endhighlight %}

There is no simpler way to combine a RESTful interface with ajax.

h2(#uhm). Uhm...

Wait. Isn't rjs considered obtrusive?

Yes. You wouldn't use this for rich clients and javascript-heavy apps. Use "backbone":http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/ instead. This is targeted at simple ajax stuff. You know, keeping simple stuff simple.

h2(#people).  What people* say

"Pragmatic Developer":http://www.google.com:

bq. Rbjs lets me prototype my ajax actions very quickly. I don't have to think about dealing with JSON response handlers. It's making my life easier.

"Lazy Developer":http://www.google.com:

bq. In the days of sophisticated client-side libraries like Backbone.js one easily forgets about good old rjs for the simple stuff. I don't always want to build a full-fledged MVC app on the client. With Rbjs I can keep my javascript on the server and my browser stays logic-less.

"Clever Developer":http://www.google.com:

bq. It's so nice to have Rbjs around. It's like having a friend with superpowers. Although I work on a javascript-heavy client, I like to fall back to rjs for the parts of my app that aren't covered by the client's logic (yet).

"Crazy Developer":http://www.google.com:

bq. When does the narwhal bacon?
