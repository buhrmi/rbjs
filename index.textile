title: A modern approach to remote javascript
---

Keep the browser logic-less.

Rbjs is a ruby gem that enables you to write remote javascript in Rails 3 or higher. With Rbjs you can render your javascript dynamically on the server and send it back to the client. Use it to quickly prototype your ajax actions. It saves you from the pain of dealing with response handlers and all the fiddly stuff. Once your app gets more javascript-heavy, you should migrate to a sophisticated client library, like "backbone":http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/.

h2(#why).  Show me an example

This example will render a link that will alert the user with a greeting when it is clicked. Find more examples in the "quick start guide":quick_start.html and learn how to use _.rbjs_ templates.

{% highlight ruby %}
# controllers/greeter_controller.rb
def greet_me
  render :js do
    window.alert "Hi there, #{current_user.name}!"
  end
end

# views/greeter/index.html.erb
link_to "Greet me!", "/greeter/greet_me", :remote => true
{% endhighlight %}

h2(#why).  What people say

"Pragmatic User":http://www.google.com:

bq. Rbjs lets me prototype my ajax actions very quickly. I don't have to think about dealing with JSON response handlers. It's making my life easier.

"Lazy User":http://www.google.com:

bq. In the days of sophisticated client-side libraries like Backbone.js one easily forgets about good old rjs for the simple stuff. I don't always want to build a full-fledged MVC app on the client. With Rbjs I can keep my javascript on the server and my browser stays logic-less.

"Lonely User":http://www.google.com:

bq. When does the narwhal bacon?
